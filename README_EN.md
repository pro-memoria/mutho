Welcome to the official implementation of the mutho ontology (music and theater ontology) developed by Promemoria Group.
This ontology serves to collect information about the plays.

The information collected ranges from the composer of the work, the participating dancers, the geographical location where the work was held to the costume designers and much more.

For more information, please visit our Wiki page at the link --> https://github.com/pro-memoria/mutho/wiki

## ONTOLOGY SCOPE

The main purpose of this ontology is to make navigable, searchable and attractive the chronology of productions of Italian opera houses (potentially the project could be extended to prose houses).

Authorial entities are defined as the list of people, characters, seasons and compositions.

The main aim of the project is to aggregate, starting from the authors and the works, the performances (productions and performances) produced by all the theatrical bodies that want to share their database.
